Introduction yay!






<h3>Researching the product requirements</h3>

Evaluation of the product requirements and how they translate into user stories.

Mindmapping how user stories will translate into features and how those features we?ll accommodate through updates in the UI.

<h3>Sketching and iteration</h3>

The bulk of the work was designing a user flow that incorporated an onboarding process and control panel, in which the user would create and manage a Google Apps accounts for their entire organization through our interface.

The biggest challenge &mdash; one that is reflective of the more complex problems that come with web hosting &mdash; dealt with guiding the user in updating their DNS records to allow them to use their personal domain as their Gmail address.

The Media Temple team consulted with engineers and reps from Google's Apps reseller team to determine the best flow for account creation, while navigating the technical limitations of both Google's reseller API and our own provisioning system.

<h3>Wireframing and prototyping</h3>

Used UXPin to create high-fidelity wireframes of both the onboarding and control panel, based off my sketches. This included a multi-step tour of the product.

I conducted user tests to validate the painstaking work we did in our onboarding flow to make DNS migration easy. Using InVision, I created a simple, clickable prototype of the domain search and purchase process, user onboarding, and a short tour of the control panel. I used five people [include link to piece about 5 users] from various departments, including support, sales, and HR and offered them Starbucks as a thank you. We made some improvements based off their mostly positive feedback.

<h3>Visual design and UI</h3>

I worked closely with our visual designer Ryan when he transformed my wires and prototypes into full-fidelity mockups of the onboarding and control panel.
