Introduction yay!






<h3>Researching the product requirements</h3>

Evaluation of the product requirements and how they translate into user stories.

Mindmapping how user stories will translate into features and how those features we?ll accommodate through updates in the UI.

Used card sorting with the group

<h3>Sketching and iteration</h3>

This product posed two big challenges:

First, we had to facilitate the user in creating or migrating their WordPress site on our platform. The onboarding experience had to describe and solicit  &mdash; in a friendly, human way &mdash; technical information like installation directories and FTP credentials. It also had to communicate the platform's architecture to the user. We took care to make sure the user understood how their WordPress sites and credentials are organized under their Media Temple account.
    
Second, the control panel was challenging simply because we were adding a number of features and bundling the WordPress hosting with other products like SSL and Google Apps.

With this in mind, I started exploring the user flow by first researching how other services did it, like [Flywheel][flywheel] or [WPEngine][wpengine]. Taking my findings and combined it with my understanding of how our backend works.

I then used card sorting with the projects devs and visual designer to organize the features and their navigation.

I then did some hi-fidelity sketching of the control panel

<h3>Wireframing and prototyping</h3>

Used UXPin to create high-fidelity wireframes of both the onboarding and control panel, based off my sketches. This included a multi-step tour of the product.

<h3>The waiting game</h3>

We knew the user would wait 30 seconds and occasionally up to two minutes for their new WordPress site to provision on our servers. So our developer Ara and I [link to Ara] decided to include a short game he had built into the onboarding experience. We let the user play a custom version of Galaga while during the site's provisioning. Currently the high score is 1200000 in two minutes.

<h3>Visual design and UI</h3>

I worked closely with our visual designer Ryan when he transformed my wires and prototypes into full-fidelity mockups of the onboarding and control panel.
