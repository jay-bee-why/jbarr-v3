Introduction yay!


<h3>Media Temple</h3>

As the UX Architect at Media Temple, I have the opportunity to touch products across products and services. While at this time I mostly create wireframes and prototypes of UI, I have a strong background in visual design for UI. Here's a sample of the work I've done, much of it with Media Temple's in-house design team.

You can check out more of my Media Temple in either of two case studies: [WordPress Hosting Control Panel][] and [Google Apps Reseller][].

<h3>Two Words For</h3>

Two Words For is a side project I've had for the last three years. It's an online arts and literary magazine with over 5,000 monthly viewers and 500 social followers that I designed and developed, under the direction of the editor and my college roommate, Alex Manthei. Each new issue aligns roughly with a major site update. To my knowledge, we were the first fully responsive, online-only lit magazine, meant to be read from any device.

Built with WordPress, it was an ambitious plan to build a single-page, app-like magazine featuring over thirty inaugural pieces, complete with sweeping animations and huge, beautiful imagery. The end result looked amazing and the positive feedback encouraged us to continue the enterprise. Unfortunately, the first version was huge in a literal sense. Slow bandwidth or mobile browsers didn't agree with Issue 0. So we completely rebuilt on another platform to perform better as the site you're reading now.

<h3>Flavorus</h3>

I worked as a designer and developer at Flavorus, an online ticketing solution for fans and clients including artists, promoters, and venues like Electric Daisy Carnival, HARD, and the Grammy Foundation. I did a little bit of everything, including website and email design, illustration, and iOS design and IA.
