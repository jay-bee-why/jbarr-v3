<h3>Retrofitting a strong foundation</h3>

<p>In 2014, Media Temple added <a href="http://mediatemple.net/wordpress/">WordPress Hosting</a> to its suite of hosting and cloud solutions. The product included a custom control panel &mdash; within the scope of the larger Media Temple control panel &mdash; that made it easy for users to create and manage their WordPress sites, and offered tools and extras like automated backups, staging sites, git integration, and custom themes.</p>

<p>While the product was performant and had a strong adoption rate, it needed some serious improvement. For one, the control panel never underwent a serious UX process before it was built. There was no on-boarding process for new users and &mdash; worse yet &mdash; there wasn&rsquo;t a strong foundation to incorporate new features into the control panel.</p>

<p>With the introduction of a new on-boarding flow, along with a slate of new features, I had the opportunity to seriously reevaluate the product&rsquo;s UX. I designed a friendly on-boarding process, reorganized the navigation and features in the control panel, and planned the product&rsquo;s information architecture to accommodate future features.</p>

<h3>Mind-mapping the product requirements</h3>

<p>The UX process started with a hefty set of user stories. During the on-boarding process, users would now have the option to create a brand new WordPress site, import a WordPress site from another hosting service, or migrate a WordPress site from another Media Temple service. This product update also bundled a few services like 1-click SSL certificate installations, a domain name, <a href="/case-study-google-apps-reselling.html">Google Apps for Work</a> inboxes, and Media Temple&rsquo;s proprietary security monitoring widget. The goal was to create an experience that makes it easy for users to host, manage, and secure their WordPress sites.</p>

<p>There was a lot to fit into the control panel. I started by mind-mapping how the user stories translated into features and how those features might be organized in the UI. I also used card sorting with team members to help finesse the control panel&rsquo;s navigation.</p>

<p><img class="large" src="/images/wordpress-mind-mapping.jpg" /></p>

<p class="caption"><strong>Left:</strong> Card sorting results. <strong>Right:</strong> Features mind-mapped on a whiteboard.</p>

<h3>Sketching and iteration</h3>

<p>This product posed two big challenges:</p>

<p>First, we had to facilitate the user in creating or migrating their WordPress site on our platform. The onboarding experience had to describe and solicit  &mdash; in a friendly, human way &mdash; technical information like installation directories and FTP credentials. It also had to communicate the platform&rsquo;s architecture to the user. We took care to make sure the user understood how their WordPress sites and credentials are organized under their Media Temple account.</p>

<p>Second, the control panel was challenging because the various features were dissimilar enough to complicate the control panel&rsquo;s information architecture. For example, two included SSL certificates are installed on a per-site basis, but Google Apps inboxes are tied to a single domain and on-boarded separately.</p>

<p>With this in mind, I started exploring the user flow by consulting with our engineers to fully understand how our back-end provisions and connects our WordPress Hosting with the rest of our services. I also took a look at the on-boarding and control panels of competitor services, like <a href="https://getflywheel.com/">Flywheel</a> or <a href="http://wpengine.com/">WPEngine</a>. I synthesized this info into a comprehensive user flow that accommodated engineering requirements.</p>

<p><img class="large" src="/images/wordpress-user-flow.png" /></p>

<p>Once the user flow was finalized, I moved on to one of my favorite steps: sketching. I moved quickly to sketching the UI in high-fidelity, which made it easy to communicate my thinking to team members and stakeholders. It also served as a strong start to my wireframing process.</p>

<p><img class="" src="/images/wordpress-panel-sketch.jpg" /></p>

<p class="caption">I used sticky notes to map out and reorganize interactions in the control panel.</p>

<h3>Wireframing and prototyping</h3>

<p>I used <a href="http://uxpin.com/">UXPin</a> to create high-fidelity wireframes of both the on-boarding experience and control panel UI with extensive notations, based off my sketches. This included a multi-step tour of the product&rsquo;s control panels. UXPin wireframes are web-based, and I prefer them as deliverables since stakeholders can easily share or comment on them.</p>

<h3>Visual design and UI</h3>

<p>I worked closely with our visual designer <a href="http://900rpm.com/">Ryan Morgan</a> as he transformed my wires and prototypes into full-fidelity mockups. We developed a card-based style that would allow for future extensibility when new features are eventually added to the panel. As the user experience became increasingly vivid, we challenged some assumptions I had and continued to finesse the finer points of the more complicated interactions, like SSL installation.</p>
