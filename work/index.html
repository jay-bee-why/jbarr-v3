			<h1>My work</h1>
			<p>I’m currently the UX Architect at <a href="http://mediatemple.net/">Media Temple</a>, a web hosting and support provider based in Los Angeles. I’m the principal UX designer and information architect, as well as a stakeholder in every product the customer touches. By its nature web hosting is technical, but I take pride in making interactions with our products easy and delightful for users.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="grid-col  span12">
			<p>I've done a bunch of stuff, including:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>I rebuilt Media Temple’s LiveChat widget from the ground up, which allows sales and support to chat with customers from our website.
				<li>Conceived the process for Media Temple users to merge multiple accounts.</li>
				<li>Designed our new Unified Cart, allowing users to purchase multiple products at once in a traditional online shopping cart experience.
				<li>Planned and designed the user on-boarding experiences for our new Google Apps products and our relaunch of our Premium WordPress product.</li>
				<li>Worked with Software Engineers to future-proof our internal ordering system by allowing users to onboard with future, yet to be developed products.</li>
				<li>Planned and designed the integration of CloudTech security and monitoring informational panels throughout the AccountCenter, which utilize Panopta and SiteLock APIs, respectively.</li>
