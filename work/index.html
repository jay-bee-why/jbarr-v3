				<h1>My work</h1>
				
				<p>I’m currently the UX Architect at <a href="http://mediatemple.net/">Media Temple</a>, a web hosting and support provider based in Los Angeles. I’m the principal UX designer and information architect, as well as a stakeholder in every product the customer touches. I started at Media Temple as a UI developer and designer. By its nature web hosting is highly technical, but I take pride in making interactions with our products easy and delightful for users.</p>
				<p>I've been lucky to work on a wide range of interesting projects like:
					
					<ul>
						<li>Multiple responsive websites with over a million views a month, including Media Temple's <a href="http://mediatemple.net/blog/news/mtredesignpost/" title="Blog post">website</a> and its <a href="http://mediatemple.net/blog/news/the-redesign-accountcenter-beta-is-open/" title="Media Temple blog">AccountCenter</a>.</li>
						<li>A <a href="http://mediatemple.net/blog/tips/building-an-animated-web-project-using-a-javascript-timeline/" title="Media Temple ad">responsive, animated ad</a> appearing on CodePen.</li>
						<li>A mission-critical <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/1399038-Support-widget-final-3-3?list=users&offset=8" title="LiveChat widget on dribbble">LiveChat sales and support widget</a>.
						<li>A <a href="http://mediatemple.net/cloudtech/report/" title="CloudTech Site Analysis">sales-generating tool</a> to help business owners analyze their website's performance.</li>
					</ul>

		        <p class="subtitle">UX Research, Wireframes</p>
		        
		        <p>The Media Temple KnowledgeBase is a curated library of self-help articles maintained by our Community Support team. It was due for a front-end update and I took the opportunity to improve its UX. I considered the existing KnowledgeBase's strengths, interpreted Google Analytics data, and evaluated the Zendesk API capabilities to improve layout and content hierarchy. Users can now more readily find the content they're searching and browsing for.</p>

		        <p class="subtitle">UX Research, Wireframes, UI Design</p>
		        
		        <p>Media Temple recently rebuilt its purchase process site-wide in order to accommodate a traditional "shopping cart" style checkout process, as well as a brand-new log-in/sign-up step, both of which were lacking in previous iterations. I leveraged my knowledge of our back-end processes to create a flow that users were familiar with, while introducing new steps like mid-checkout authentication.</p>
